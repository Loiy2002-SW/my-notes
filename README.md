# About me

### My name is Loai, and I'm passionate about mobile app development. Currently, I'm expanding my skill set by diving into .Net Development.

# What I learned from Lecture 1

1. The important of Git, Github:
* It helps tracking the code.
* Allows working with a team with the ability of conflict resolving.
* Adding a historical recovery of the code.

2. The important of README file, and new Markdown commands.

3. The purpose of all software is to help people.

4. Every programmer is a designer.
